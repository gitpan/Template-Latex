NAME
    Template::Latex - Latex support for the Template Toolkit

SYNOPSIS
        use Template::Latex;
    
        my $tt = Template::Latex->new({
            INCLUDE_PATH  => '/path/to/templates',
            OUTPUT_PATH   => '/path/to/pdf/output',
            LATEX_FORMAT  => 'pdf',
        });
        my $vars = {
            title => 'Hello World',
        }
        $tt->process('example.tt2', $vars, 'example.pdf')
            || die $tt->error();

INSTALLATION
    You must first install the Template Toolkit version 2.16 or later
    (available from CPAN) and the latex, pdflatex and dvips programs
    (available from http://www.latex-project.org/).

    Then install the Template-Latex distribution.

        $ tar zxf Template-Latex-2.16.tar.gz
        $ cd Template-Latex-2.16
        $ make
        $ make test
        $ sudo make install

OVERVIEW
    The Template::Latex distribution contains the Template::Latex
    and Template::Plugin::Latex modules.  These add support to the
    Template Toolkit for generating PDF, PostScript and DVI documents
    from LaTeX templates.  

    The 'latex' filter was available as a core part of the Template
    Toolkit until version 2.15 release in May 2006 when it was moved
    into this separate distribution.  Now you must explicitly use the 
    'Latex' plugin to load Template::Latex and install the 'latex'
    filter.

        [% USE Latex %]
        [% FILTER latex("example.pdf") %] 
        \documentclass{article}
        \begin{document}
        This is a PDF document generated by 
        Latex and the Template Toolkit.
        \end{document}
        [% END %]

    Alternately, you can use the Template::Latex module as a direct 
    replacement for the Template module.  It implicitly defines
    the 'latex' filter so that you don't need to load the plugin.

        my $tt = Template::Latex->new(\%config);
        $tt->process($input, \%vars, $output)
            || die $t->error();

    Please consult the documentation for Template::Latex and 
    Template::Plugin::Latex for further information.
